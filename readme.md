# Sequence Digit Interference Experiment

The experiment was designed to observe the effect of changing a digit in a highly practiced sequence (causing a conflict between memory and visual input) on the planning of previous presses. Moving window size was used as our independent variable. The window size was either 2, 3, 4, 11. The length of sequences were 11.  

Participants were divided into two groups. They performed three sessions, one for training, and two for test. Each session comprised of a pre and a post block to check for the persistence of sequence speicifc learning (testing on train vs untrained on those blocks). 

In the first session, participants were trained on specific sequences for four blocks. Each block had 32 trials. 

In the next two sessions, each consisting of ten blocks, sometimes randomly a digit of the trained sequence at either locations 5, 7, or 9 would change randomly. The probability of this purturbation happening was 1 to 2. Each of the blocks had 30 trials. 2/5 of trials were random sequences, 2/5 unchanged trained sequences, and 1/5 changed trained sequences. Particiapnts were asked to perform better than 85% accuracy. 

There was a precue time of 1500 ms, ITI of 3000ms.
